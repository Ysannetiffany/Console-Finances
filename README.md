This aim of this project is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month
and then find the average.
( Total/(Number of months - 1) )

The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.

The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
